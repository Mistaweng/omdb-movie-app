# Movie App Frontend

This project is the frontend of the Movie App, built using React and bootstrapped with Create React App. The application allows users to search for movies and view details such as title, year of release, and poster.

## Prerequisites
Before running the application, ensure you have the following installed:

Node.js (version 18 or later)
npm (comes with Node.js) or yarn

## Setup Instructions
In the project directory, follow these steps:

## 1. Install Dependencies
`npm install`

### 2. Start the Application

`npm start`
This will open the app in your browser at http://localhost:3000.

### 3. Running Tests

`npm test`
This will launch the test runner in interactive watch mode. The project uses Jest and React Testing Library for unit and integration tests.

### 4. Building the App
To create a production-ready build of the app, run:
`npm run build`

### 5. Ejecting from Create React App

`npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**
